## Question 4: Can I appeal my degree classification?

**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, you can appeal your degree classification under specific circumstances. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Grounds for Appeal:
- You may appeal if you wish to challenge the class of degree awarded on procedural grounds (AA 1.5(c)). This means you must demonstrate that there was a procedural error or irregularity in how your degree classification was determined.
- A prima facie case (a case that appears valid at first glance) must exist, based on one or more of the following (AA 1.6):
  - **(a)** A material administrative error or irregularity in the assessment process that adversely affected your results.
  - **(b)** Significant exceptional circumstances (e.g., illness, personal hardship) that adversely affected your performance and were not known to the examiners at the time.
  - **(c)** Unfair treatment or discrimination (excluding academic judgment).

### 2. Timing:
- You must submit your appeal within 15 calendar days of the formal publication of results (AA 1.3). Exceptions to this deadline are rare and require approval from the Head of Academic Quality, Standards and Conduct.

### 3. Process:
- The appeal must be based on evidence that was not available at the time of the examiners' decision and could have influenced their recommendation (AA 1.6).
- The University will review the appeal to establish facts and reach a reasonable and just resolution (AA 1.8).

### 4. Outcomes:
- If your appeal is upheld, potential outcomes may include:
  - Confirmation of the existing degree classification (if no error is found).
  - Adjustment of the classification if procedural errors or exceptional circumstances are proven (though specific outcomes depend on the case).

### 5. Important Notes:
- Appeals cannot challenge academic judgment (e.g., disagreements with markers' opinions) (AA 1.1).
- Frivolous or spurious appeals may result in disciplinary action (AA 1.9).
- The process is confidential, and you will not be disadvantaged for making a good-faith appeal (AA 1.10–1.11).

**Summary:** Yes, you can appeal your degree classification if you have valid procedural grounds (e.g., administrative errors, exceptional circumstances, or unfair treatment) and submit the appeal within the deadline. The appeal must be evidence-based and relate to factors not previously considered by examiners.

## Question 5: What counts as "exceptional circumstances"?

**Answer:**

According to the context, "exceptional circumstances" refers to situations that are outside the control of the student and result in circumstances that are thought reasonably to have caused an individual student to fail to complete all required assessments by a stipulated deadline or to complete assessed work to a lesser standard of academic performance.

Specifically, GR 2.6.2 states that exceptional circumstances can be considered as such actions or events outside the control of the student that result in any circumstances which are thought reasonably to have caused an individual student:

- **(a)** to fail to complete all the required assessment for a programme or contributing module by a stipulated deadline (e.g. missed exam or CWA deadline);
- **(b)** to complete assessed work to a lesser standard of academic performance than might reasonably have been expected on the basis of performance elsewhere during their study (where the same circumstances have not applied).

In other words, exceptional circumstances are situations that are beyond the student's control and have a significant impact on their academic performance.

## Question 7: What happens if I'm borderline between degree classes?

**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, here is what happens if you are borderline between degree classes:

### For Undergraduate Students:

**1. Higher Award Criteria:**
- If you are borderline, you may receive the higher award if:
  - Half or more of your Part II credits are in the higher class, or
  - Your final year average is in the higher class.

**2. Lower Award (Default):**
- If you do not meet either of the above criteria, you will normally be awarded the lower class of degree.

**3. Special Cases:**
- Examination Boards can make a special case to the Committee of Senate (via the Classification and Assessment Review Board) if they believe the recommended degree class should deviate from the strict application of the regulations due to individual circumstances not already considered.

### For Postgraduate Taught Students (MARP 2025-26 & 2024-25):

**1. Borderline Ranges:**
- 68.0–69.9% → Either Distinction or Merit
- 58.0–59.9% → Either Merit or Pass
- 48.0–49.9% → Either Pass or Fail

**2. Higher Award Criteria:**
- You may receive the higher award if half or more of your credits across the programme are in the higher class.

**3. Lower Award (Default):**
- If you do not meet the credit requirement, you will normally be awarded the lower class.

**4. Special Cases:**
- Examination Boards can make a special case to the Committee of Senate (via the PGT Classification and Assessment Review Board) if they believe the recommended award should deviate from the strict regulations due to individual circumstances not already accounted for.

**5. Additional Note (Postgraduate Only):**
- If you fail a taught Master's degree (after reassessment) or withdraw, you may still be eligible for a Postgraduate Diploma or Certificate, provided:
  - The programme regulations allow for these awards.
  - You have earned enough credits for them.

### Summary:
- Borderline cases are decided based on credit distribution (Undergraduate: Part II credits / Postgraduate: overall programme credits) or final year average (Undergraduate only).
- If criteria are not met, the lower award is given by default.
- Special cases can be made for exceptional circumstances not already considered.

## Question 10: I'm an Integrated Masters student in Chemistry (MChem) and I'm worried about failing my final year project. What are the specific consequences for my degree, and are there any accredited vs. non-accredited exit awards?

**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, here are the specific consequences for your MChem (Hons) Chemistry degree if you fail your final year project, along with details about exit awards:

### Consequences of Failing the Final Year Project (MChem)

**1. No Condonation for Major Projects:**
- The regulations explicitly state that major project modules (individual or group) cannot be condoned for the award of an MChem (Hons) Chemistry (or variant) (Section 12.2). This means you must pass the project module to progress or graduate with the MChem degree.

**2. Exit Award Eligibility:**
- If you do not progress to Year 4 of the MChem (e.g., due to failing the project or other modules), you may be eligible for the BSc (Hons) Chemistry exit award, provided you have successfully completed Year 3 (Section 12.3).
- If you fail Year 4 after exhausting all resit opportunities, you will still be eligible for the BSc (Hons) Chemistry exit award (Section 12.4).

**3. No Condonation for Practical Elements:**
- Additionally, practical elements of any modules cannot be condoned for the MChem or BSc (Hons) Chemistry awards (Section 12.1). This means you must pass all practical components without exception.

### Accredited vs. Non-Accredited Exit Awards

- The context does not explicitly mention whether the BSc (Hons) Chemistry exit award is professionally accredited. However, it does note that certain degrees with professional accreditation have additional requirements (UG 5.9, Page 12), which are detailed in Appendix 5 of the regulations.
- For BA (Hons) Architecture, the document specifies accreditation by ARB and RIBA (Section 13.1), but no equivalent accrediting body is mentioned for Chemistry.
- Since the context does not provide details on Chemistry accreditation, you would need to refer to Appendix 5 (not provided here) or consult your department for clarification.

### Summary of Key Points

- Failing the final year project means you cannot be awarded the MChem degree unless you pass it (no condonation).
- You may still qualify for a BSc (Hons) Chemistry exit award if you meet Year 3 requirements.
- The BSc exit award's accreditation status is not specified in this context—check Appendix 5 or your department for details.

## Question 11: I submitted an appeal on procedural grounds and it was rejected at Stage 1. What options do I have next, and what is the role of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator?

**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, here is a detailed answer to your question:

### Options After Stage 1 Rejection:

**1. Stage 2 – Student Casework Review:**
- You have the right to request a review of the Stage 1 decision.
- The procedure and form for requesting this review are available on the Student Casework Review pages.
- You must submit your request for a review within two weeks of receiving the Stage 1 written decision.

**2. Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA):**
- If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your appeal after completing all internal university procedures (including Stage 2, if applicable), you can escalate your case to the OIA.
- The OIA is an independent body that reviews student complaints and appeals for higher education institutions, including Lancaster University.
- Before approaching the OIA, you must have exhausted all internal appeals processes. The university will issue a Completion of Procedures letter if your appeal is not upheld. If your appeal is upheld or partially upheld, you can request this letter.
- You must submit your complaint to the OIA within 12 months of receiving the Completion of Procedures letter.

### Role of the OIA:

- The OIA reviews cases where students believe the university's appeal process was flawed or unfair.
- It assesses whether the university followed its procedures correctly and whether the decision was reasonable.
- The OIA can recommend remedies if it finds that something went wrong, such as recommending the university reconsider the case or provide compensation.

### Key Points to Note:

- You cannot introduce new issues once the appeal is in progress.
- The OIA will only consider your case after you have completed all internal university appeal stages.

## Question 12: I accepted my offer in March 2025 for entry in October 2025. Which version of MARP applies to me if the University changes regulations in July 2025?

**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, specifically MARP 2025-26, Page 8, I can answer your question.

According to the context, applicants who have accepted an offer must be informed of any substantive changes to the academic regulations since the point of offer. Since you accepted your offer in March 2025 for entry in October 2025, and the University changes regulations in July 2025, the relevant version of MARP that applies to you would be the one published on or before 1 September 2025.

However, the context does not explicitly state what version of MARP would be applicable to you if the University changes regulations after the offer has been made but before 1 September 2025. It only mentions that applicants should be provided with the version of the academic regulations which will be in place when they enter the programme.

It is unclear whether this implies that the version of MARP that was in place when you accepted your offer in March 2025 would still apply to you if the University changes regulations in July 2025.

## Question 13: What is the minimum credit requirement for a Postgraduate Certificate (PGCert)?

**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, the minimum credit requirement for a Postgraduate Certificate (PGCert) is **60 credits**, with no more than 20 credits having been defined as being undergraduate in level.

This is explicitly stated in the following sections of the context:

1. **PORTFOLIO OF DEGREE AWARDS AND OTHER ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS (Page 6):**
   - "for a postgraduate certificate, a total of at least 60 credits, with no more than 20 credits having been defined as being undergraduate in level."

2. **POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS (Page 2 and Page 3):**
   - "60 (minimum of 40 at FHEQ level 7)" (indicating that at least 40 credits must be at level 7, with the remaining 20 potentially at undergraduate level).
   - "for a Postgraduate Certificate, a total of at least 60 credits, with no more than 20 credits having been defined as being undergraduate in level."

Thus, the minimum total credit requirement is 60 credits, with a cap on undergraduate-level credits.
