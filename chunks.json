Programmes may also have non-PSRB requirements which are approved variations on standard regulations. These additional requirements are set out below. 1 MA/PGDip Social Work 1.1 Practice elements 1.1.1 Level 6 assessments (i.e. Practice Portfolios) are marked pass or fail. Students failing the level 6 elements, but passing the level 7 elements will be eligible for the award of the MA or PGDip Applied Social Studies. 1.2 Examinations which assess the students’ knowledge of the Law 1.2.1 Students must obtain a pass mark in examinations in the areas of Social Work with Children & Families, Mental Distress & Health and Social Work in Adult Social Care. In order to meet this examination requirement, students are eligible to undertake up to two resits of the examination and the module mark will be capped at either 50% or the first attempt module mark if higher than 50%. 1.3 Condonation 1.3.1 There is no condonation of the direct practice element of the placement modules or of Social Work with Children & Families, Mental Distress & Health and Social Work in Adult Social Care where the examination is failed. 1.3.2 Where condonation is being considered for a Social Work student, a special re-sit assessment panel made up of all markers will consider if the student has satisfactorily met Social Work England’s Professional Standards and The College of Social Work's Professional Capabilities Framework in other work."}},{"id":"00688732-67a4-4612-8923-1adb086d1611","payload":{"document_id":"6b8cbe7b8aabe13549093b73b3a065b5","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"ACADEMIC APPEALS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Academic-Appeals.pdf","pageCount":11,"page":9,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Academic-Appeals.pdf","chunk_index":13,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":2036,"chunk_length":2036,"text":"MARP 2025-26 Academic Appeals Postgraduate (Research) – pre final examination (a) Confirm the decision of the transfer panel regarding the student's registration.

Wherever the idea originates, all relevant parties who will be involved in the proposed partnership must be consulted in the preliminary stages of consideration, during which an evaluation of the proposed partner institution and partnership must be conducted to establish: (a) alignment with the University’s overall Strategic Plan and any relevant strategies at departmental and faculty level; (b) that the partner is in good standing academically, legally, financially, and politically; (c) that the partnership does not present a significant risk to Lancaster University nor conflict with existing Lancaster University partnerships; (d) whether there is any significant financial investment or risk for the University. CP 4.2.2 If, following this initial evaluation, a decision is taken to go ahead with the proposed partnership, depending on the associated complexity and risk, the appropriate approvals procedure will commence.

Definition of the viva voce 1.1 A viva voce is an oral examination of a research degree thesis, and of the student who wrote it, which is normally conducted in person, at Lancaster, by an internal and an external examiner. 1.2 The first stage of the examination is the review of the student’s thesis. Student and Programme Administration is responsible for sending a copy of the thesis to each examiner. The examiners independently read the thesis and write a Pre-Viva Voce report on it, with comments about its contribution to the field, its strengths and weaknesses, and possibly a range of points which they will raise at the viva voce. 2. Status of the viva voce 2.1 The viva voce is a compulsory part of all research degree examinations unless otherwise specified in the regulations however excellent or poor the thesis may be. The student always has the right to defend their work to the examiners. 2.2 It is not possible under current regulations for a student to fail a research degree outright without undertaking a viva voce. 3. Role of each participant in the viva voce 3.1 The external examiner(s): the role of the external examiner(s) (someone not connected with the University) is to assess the quality of the submission and help to uphold the quality of the degree in the UK. 3.2 In certain circumstances, there may be a third examiner, external to the University, involved to ensure impartiality."}},{"id":"206248c3-1d82-4dba-ba10-67f051528810","payload":{"document_id":"c6fa37cc5fb669cc9435d45414979523","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"STUDY REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Study-Regs.pdf","pageCount":14,"page":13,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Study-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":21,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1977,"chunk_length":1977,"text":"MARP 2025-26 Study Regulations (ii) the same examination paper as other undergraduates, but with additional special questions which take account of the changed syllabus; (iii) a specially set examination paper; (c) any changes, since the last academic year, where coursework will be taken into account.

Amended regulations that are applicable to different cohorts of students are differentiated within MARP at the appropriate place.2 AMENDMENTS TO THE ACADEMIC REGULATIONS – RELATED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES 7. Amendments may be made to MARP which impact on applicants between the offer and registration stage, and which represent a change to the University’s terms and conditions and therefore the contract with the applicant. In accordance with the CMA guidance on consumer law in relation to Higher Education,3 the University will inform applicants of any significant changes to the academic regulations since they first applied. 8. Irrespective of when a new/amended academic regulation is introduced, current students are consulted on any significant amendments through the student representation on the relevant University committees. 9. The application of new/amended regulations to particular cohorts of students will be agreed as part of the approval process for the change. 10. Notwithstanding paragraph 7 above, wherever possible, applicants should be provided with the version of the academic regulations which will be in place when they enter the programme. New/amended academic regulations should then have been approved by 1 September in the year prior to them taking effect (e.g. by 1 September 2020 for introduction from October 2021)."}},{"id":"25757753-6d20-4e97-bcb5-b5434f03428a","payload":{"document_id":"f8fde8dfb2f5c1c0c3e1451b3625b14a","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs.pdf","pageCount":18,"page":7,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":10,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1897,"chunk_length":1897,"text":"MARP 2025-26 Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations PT 6.6 The overall profile will only then be considered for classification when all the results of reassessment are available.

The Library and Professional Services are then required to ensure that their forward planning and priorities can properly support agreed academic priorities.

CD 1.1.4 If necessary, for example where a proposed degree programme is outwith the award/ programme criteria approved by Senate (see The Portfolio of Degree Awards, PA 3), approval in principle for a programme can be sought from the appropriate committee(s) early in the process, before the proposal is fully worked up for consideration by departmental or the faculty committees responsible for oversight.

CD 2.5 Programme closure and suspension CD 2.5.1 Departments may propose the closure of programmes for a variety of different reasons. Programme closure requires formal faculty and institutional approval (from the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate to approve the laying down of programmes). Where programme closure is agreed, appropriate arrangements must be put in place to protect the needs of any students who remain registered on the programme as it is taught out, to ensure that they can complete their programme with minimum possible disruption or adverse impact. Consideration must also be given to any applicants to whom an offer of admission has been made before closure was proposed."}},{"id":"3d74867e-1b63-4f7e-b549-4da472ef63d0","payload":{"document_id":"2d73820b57042c9a2ca957b14e2ae49c","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"UNDERGRADUATE ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS INCLUDING REGULATIONS FOR INTEGRATED MASTERS AWARDS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/UG-Assess-Regs.pdf","pageCount":36,"page":27,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/UG-Assess-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":51,"chunk_start":1695,"chunk_end":2869,"chunk_length":1174,"text":"In order to progress from Year 1 to Year 2 on the LLB Law (Clinical Learning) programme students must pass at the first attempt and achieve a Part I aggregation score of 11.5.

UG 6.4.2 Both final and non-final year students will be given the opportunity to undertake reassessment within the same academic year in which they made their first attempt. UG 6.4.3 Where reassessment is prohibited for reasons of professional accreditation this will be clearly stated in the assessment guidelines provided to students and alternative awards and other available options identified. UG 6.4.4 Students may not seek reassessment to improve a passing grade unless required for professional accreditation and allowed under specific accreditation arrangements (see Appendix 5 of the Undergraduate Assessment Regulations for further details). UG 6.4.5 When all the results of reassessment are available the overall profile will then be considered following procedures detailed below in the section on the consideration and confirmation of results."}},{"id":"401eabfe-25ff-4aff-9a30-958b0793cb7c","payload":{"document_id":"e702f07444d4250c7c5d5c975b5916d3","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"EXTERNAL EXAMINER PROCEDURES (TAUGHT PROGRAMMES)","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Taught-Progs-EE-Procedures.pdf","pageCount":17,"page":13,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Taught-Progs-EE-Procedures.pdf","chunk_index":24,"chunk_start":1890,"chunk_end":3033,"chunk_length":1143,"text":"INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO THE EXTERNAL EXAMINER ON OR SOON AFTER APPOINTMENT EE 4.2.4 As well as briefing on the programme and its assessment regulations, departments shall provide the following information to the external examiner on, or soon after, their appointment.

These are designed to help assure the quality and standards of the University’s awards and programmes and the student academic experience. Non-academic policies, regulations and procedures are published elsewhere on the University’s website. MARP applies to all categories of student, all academic programmes, and all types of award (teaching partnerships may require separate or varied regulations). It covers the following range of awards validated by the University, including those delivered on a collaborative teaching basis with partner institutions: (a) undergraduate degrees, diplomas and certificates (including foundation degrees) (b) postgraduate taught degrees, diplomas and certificates (c) postgraduate research degrees. MARP is divided into separate sets of regulations, and quality assurance and enhancement processes: • Introduction to the Manual • Portfolio of Awards • Admissions • Recognition of Prior Learning • Study Regulations • General Regulations for Assessment and Award • Undergraduate Assessment Regulations • Medical Degree Assessment Regulations • Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations • Postgraduate Research Regulations • Academic Integrity Regulations and Procedures • External Examiner Procedures for Taught Programmes • Academic Appeals • Management of Standards and Quality • Course Design, Development and Approval • For Course Evaluation & Review, please see the relevant section of the AQSC website. • Collaborative Teaching Partnership Provision STATUS OF MARP AND COMPLIANCE The autonomy of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with degree awarding powers is enshrined in legislation, and mediated by external regulations, codes of practice and guidelines.

All assessments and marking schemes should be created with the aim of ensuring that the resulting grades/marks give a good indication of the ability and application of the students. However, it is inevitable that on occasion this will not work as planned. 2. Reasons may include a misprinted examination paper, the interruption of an examination or, in a science laboratory, an instrumental malfunction not obvious at the time of the experiment; or it may simply be that examiners agree, using their academic judgment and with the benefit of hindsight, that an assessment, or part of an assessment, proved to be significantly harder or easier than expected. 3. In such cases it is appropriate to consider whether the marks should be scaled. Scaling may be of the overall mark for the module or of any assessment therein. 4. Although an unusual distribution of grades/marks is not of itself a sufficient reason for scaling to be applied, it may be an indication that something has gone wrong. For this reason, if the overall mean aggregation score for any module lies outside the range 14.5- 17.5 (or 58% to 68% for percentage marks) then examiners must consider whether or not there is a case for the marks to be scaled. Note: For International and Regional Teaching Partnership provision the range outside which scaling must be considered is 13.5-17.0 (or 55% to 66.7%) 5. Where the possibility of scaling is being discussed, the precise method should also be discussed and should reflect both the nature of the assessment and the size of the cohort. Both the reason for scaling and the method used must be justified within the minutes of the examining body. If scaling is discussed and not used, the reason for not scaling must be recorded in the minutes."}},{"id":"423ed81c-4682-4a1f-aefb-dc58df3f9569","payload":{"document_id":"72ea550eba281d3ec855e855515ebfe8","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","pageCount":20,"page":20,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","chunk_index":32,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":289,"chunk_length":289,"text":"MARP 2024-25 Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations APPENDIX 4: DETAIL OF IN-YEAR CHANGE MADE TO CHAPTER Version Date of change Detail of change & section(s) altered Approval of change 1.1 31/10/2024 Accessibility updates to title page and heading n/a — admin structure.

These are designed to help assure the quality and standards of the University’s awards and programmes and the student academic experience. Non-academic policies, regulations and procedures are published elsewhere on the University’s website. MARP applies to all categories of student, all academic programmes, and all types of award (teaching partnerships may require separate or varied regulations). It covers the following range of awards validated by the University, including those delivered on a collaborative teaching basis with partner institutions: (a) undergraduate degrees, diplomas and certificates (including foundation degrees) (b) postgraduate taught degrees, diplomas and certificates (c) postgraduate research degrees. MARP is divided into separate sets of regulations, and quality assurance and enhancement processes: • Introduction to the Manual • Portfolio of Awards • Admissions • Recognition of Prior Learning • Study Regulations • General Regulations for Assessment and Award • Undergraduate Assessment Regulations • Medical Degree Assessment Regulations • Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations • Postgraduate Research Regulations • Academic Integrity Regulations and Procedures • External Examiner Procedures for Taught Programmes • Academic Appeals • Management of Standards and Quality • Course Design, Development and Approval • For Course Evaluation & Review, please see the relevant section of the AQSC website. • Collaborative Teaching Partnership Provision STATUS OF MARP AND COMPLIANCE The autonomy of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with degree awarding powers is enshrined in legislation, and mediated by external regulations, codes of practice and guidelines. Lancaster University regulations and procedures, including those contained in MARP, are therefore informed by, and comply and align with, the following: (a) principles of good practice, including those in the UK Quality Code for Higher Education; Version 1.0 2"}},{"id":"5f912270-349e-4863-ab7c-7428c930f06f","payload":{"document_id":"c6fa37cc5fb669cc9435d45414979523","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"STUDY REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Study-Regs.pdf","pageCount":14,"page":11,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Study-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":17,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1872,"chunk_length":1872,"text":"MARP 2025-26 Study Regulations Academic Tutor system SR 4.2.3 All undergraduates will have a named personal Academic Tutor who is a full member of academic staff (postgraduate research students and Research Assistants are not eligible to be an Academic Tutor).

The Executive Dean of each faculty has formal responsibility for quality assurance and enhancement, but in practice this is devolved to undergraduate and postgraduate Associate Deans."}},{"id":"67c7db26-4849-49b3-a423-271a2973120b","payload":{"document_id":"c6fa37cc5fb669cc9435d45414979523","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"STUDY REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Study-Regs.pdf","pageCount":14,"page":3,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Study-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":2,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1984,"chunk_length":1984,"text":"MARP 2025-26 Study Regulations MARP 2025-26 STUDY REGULATIONS SR 1 UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES SR 1.1 EQUITY AND CONSISTENCY OF TREATMENT SR 1.1.1 In the management of quality and standards, the University needs to ensure and demonstrate consistency in approach between different departments and in the equitable treatment of all students in terms of admissions, learning, teaching and assessment, academic discipline and awards. Individual academics have the autonomy to teach and communicate lawful ideas which may be controversial, unpopular, or offensive, within the remit of their professional experience and qualifications. SR 1.1.2 All members of the University have a responsibility to treat all other members fairly and equitably. SR 1.1.3 Students have the right to express lawful speech and their beliefs as a part of their academic studies. No student will be unreasonably prevented from expressing these where relevant. SR 1.1.4 Students should be treated on the basis of capacity and potential and should not be disadvantaged on any grounds irrelevant to academic study. SR 1.2 COMMUNICATIONS WITH STUDENTS SR 1.2.1 Students should be provided with accurate, relevant and timely information and should be informed of the primary means by which their academic departments, colleges, Student and Education Services and other units will communicate with them and when this will happen. SR 1.2.2 Students are required to regularly check their Lancaster email accounts for official communications and notifications of the status of their registration and studies. SR 1.2.3 It is the responsibility of students to maintain links with their academic department and the central administration, respond to requests for information, acknowledge specific communications related to the status of their registration and studies. Students are required to inform the University’s Student and Programme Administration of any changes in their contact details, including any changes of address."}},{"id":"68064235-f527-4959-8a37-4fdc10ef8f5d","payload":{"document_id":"aed7db9c7ebfd737f4c508471b776f3b","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"COURSE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CDDA.pdf","pageCount":12,"page":1,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CDDA.pdf","chunk_index":0,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1216,"chunk_length":1216,"text":"NOTICE: these regulations are suspended during the Curriculum Transformation Programme (CTP), and superseded by the Programme and Module Approval Policy for Delivery of CTP.

Significant new regulations, policies and procedures are generally reviewed after one operational year and thereafter at regular intervals to ensure they remain relevant and fit for purpose. In addition, on occasion, a major development or project undertaken by the University may result in a requirement to review and amend associated regulations, policies and procedures contained in MARP, with SCAR making recommendations to ASQC on any such amendments. APPLICATION OF MARP TO APPLICANTS AND STUDENTS MARP is published on an annual basis and the regulations and procedures contained in it apply to all students currently registered with the University, or with a collaborative teaching partner (CTP) where the programme of study leads to an award of the University. Where approved changes to the regulations are applicable only to new cohorts entering the programme this will be indicated at the appropriate point in the regulations. Changes which may be disadvantageous to students will not normally be implemented for existing students - see further information in the Academic Regulations Management Protocol (attached).

As a result, it may sometimes be necessary to amend these regulations over the course of a student’s registration to match national decisions about undergraduate medical education and to ensure continued alignment with sector standards. Changes will be made only where necessary to ensure the appropriate level of competence in graduates from the programme as they move onto their postgraduate training, and to ensure patient safety. MD 1 STRUCTURE OF THE MBChB DEGREE PROGRAMME MD 1.1 The MBChB degree comprises learning across levels 4, 5, 6 and 7 over a five-year full- time programme. There is no stipulated credit length for each year of study as medical qualifications are not typically credit rated. MD 1.2 The Medicine with a Gateway Year degree is a six-year programme comprised of an initial year of study (Gateway Year), with progression onto the five-year MBChB degree programme where students meet the progression criteria. MD 1.3 Fitness to practise requirements apply to students studying on the Gateway Year as well as to those on the MBChB degree programme. Fitness to practise requirements apply to all course content, regardless of whether this provision is delivered directly by the Lancaster Medical School, or by another academic department or source. MD 1.4 Attendance and active engagement in all scheduled teaching sessions, clinical placements, and prescribed course activities are mandatory components of the medical programme as they all relate to GMC Outcomes for Graduates. Students are expected to demonstrate a satisfactory level of attendance and engagement throughout the academic year, as determined by the Medical School's monitoring processes."}},{"id":"6b7fbdd1-d9f0-4c04-9e0b-d0b6fad7b082","payload":{"document_id":"72ea550eba281d3ec855e855515ebfe8","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","pageCount":20,"page":15,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","chunk_index":24,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1858,"chunk_length":1858,"text":"MARP 2024-25 Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations APPENDIX 2: GUIDANCE FOR SCALING OF MARKS 1. All assessments and marking schemes should be created with the aim of ensuring that the resulting grades/marks give a good indication of the ability and application of the students. However, it is inevitable that on occasion this will not work as planned. 2. Reasons may include a misprinted examination paper, the interruption of an examination or, in a science laboratory, an instrumental malfunction not obvious at the time of the experiment; or it may simply be that examiners agree, using their academic judgment and with the benefit of hindsight, that an assessment, or part of an assessment, proved to be significantly harder or easier than expected. 3. In such cases it is appropriate to consider whether the marks should be scaled. Scaling may be of the overall mark for the module or of any assessment therein. 4. Although an unusual distribution of grades/marks is not of itself a sufficient reason for scaling to be applied, it may be an indication that something has gone wrong. For this reason, if the overall mean aggregation score for any module lies outside the range 14.5- 17.5 (or 58% to 68% for percentage marks) then examiners must consider whether or not there is a case for the marks to be scaled. Note: For International and Regional Teaching Partnership provision the range outside which scaling must be considered is 13.5-17.0 (or 55% to 66.7%) 5. Where the possibility of scaling is being discussed, the precise method should also be discussed and should reflect both the nature of the assessment and the size of the cohort. Both the reason for scaling and the method used must be justified within the minutes of the examining body. If scaling is discussed and not used, the reason for not scaling must be recorded in the minutes."}},{"id":"6b9d22b8-c8c0-4269-a186-255ce1ae584c","payload":{"document_id":"231277f51382309723edf421361111f2","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"GENERAL REGULATIONS FOR ASSESSMENT & AWARD","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/General-Regs.pdf","pageCount":30,"page":4,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/General-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":5,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":2026,"chunk_length":2026,"text":"MARP 2025-26 General Regulations for Assessment & Award (a) informs and promotes learning by providing students with feedback on the quality of their work (b) measures students’ academic achievement thereby informing progression within the programme and degree classification; (c) assures standards by demonstrating that the University’s expectations of student achievement are consistent with other HEIs and employer expectations; (d) provides data which aids the ongoing development of teaching and learning approaches.

Note that where calibration is employed, work marked using calibration should form part of the sample presented for moderation, but does not need to be over and above that sample;8 or (d) analyses of marking trends, where work is marked by only one marker, undertaking a comparative analysis of marking trends to compare individual students’ consequential marks on an individual course with their average mark on all their other courses; and (e) calibration, whereby departments use initial calibration exercises within marker teams in advance of marking and moderation periods, to foster a shared set of norms for marking teams. Guidance on the use of calibration can be found in the Curriculum and Education Development Academy’s webpages.

CP 1.3 Lancaster University is able to award the following types of qualifications through collaborative teaching partnerships. (a) A Single Degree is a degree awarded by Lancaster University only. Single degree awards are typically made where the collaborative partner, which delivers the programme, does not have its own degree awarding powers (for example UK FE colleges or overseas institutions which are comparatively recently established and have not yet been given degree awarding powers by their respective governments).

They cover those cases where an individual wishes to receive credit for one or more modules that form part of a programme of study leading to a Lancaster qualification on the grounds that they have already achieved, via the prior learning described in PL 1.3, the required learning outcomes for the Lancaster module(s). For the different types of prior learning the procedural outcome is either: (a) the recognition of UK credit gained elsewhere, described as ‘credit transfer’; or (b) the award of Lancaster credit for cases of ‘certificated learning’ or ‘experiential learning’; described here as the accreditation of prior learning (APL) for the former and the accreditation of prior experiential learning (APEL) for the latter.

They enable the University to assure itself that credit for such learning is comparable to that achieved through the teaching and learning activities required for specified modules for the Lancaster University programme on which the student will be registered. PL 1.2 These procedures apply to individual students and not to institutional arrangements for the recognition of credit (see PL 1.6). They cover those cases where an individual wishes to receive credit for one or more modules that form part of a programme of study leading to a Lancaster qualification on the grounds that they have already achieved, via the prior learning described in PL 1.3, the required learning outcomes for the Lancaster module(s).

This allows ITP provision to be considered by link departments, Faculty committees and ASQC alongside in-house provision. Additionally a summary of issues raised in the ITP reports is produced for consideration by ASQC and CPOC. The University requires its ITPs to carry out ATRs at the same time as at Lancaster (between July and October for UG programmes). Sunway University conducts its ATRs on a slightly different cycle as their academic year is a calendar year. The University’s ATR report template is adapted for each individual ITP to take account of local terminology, the relevant academic cycle and any additional local requirements. CP 6.5.2 ITP activities and provision are also considered when Lancaster link departments undergo PQR. Again, this allows ITP provision to be considered alongside in-house provision.

However, where appropriate and possible, it is permitted to allow consideration for grades to be transferred where these have been gained elsewhere as part of a Lancaster programme, or from specific partners, or on a case-by-case basis. This will be at the discretion of the exam board.

For procedural purposes, revisions to programmes and modules are categorised as ‘minor’ or ‘major’. Revisions may be made for a variety of reasons, including: (a) in response to student or external examiner feedback; (b) in response to developments in the subject area; (c) in response to a non-negotiable requirement of a PSRB; (d) in response to practical issues, such as staff changes or changes to student numbers. CD 2.3.2 A major revision involves material changes that affect a programme. A major revision may be either a direct change to a programme and/or significant changes to a module or modules which significantly alter a programme and its delivery, for example, substantive revisions to educational aims, intended learning outcomes, teaching, learning and assessment strategies, academic level, changes to programme structure. The University’s Guidance on revisions to programmes and modules contains examples of major revisions. CD 2.3.3 A minor revision to a programme or module involves a change to the subject matter, method of delivery, or learning, teaching and assessment strategy that: (i) does not affect the programme learning outcomes; (ii) has no significant resources implications; and (iii) is limited to change involving no more than 25% of the programme credits. Some apparently minor revisions may raise broader questions which require further information, fuller discussion or consideration as a major revision. A series of incremental minor revisions should also be considered as a major revision so that consideration is given as to whether or not the volume and nature of these changes significantly alters the programme and its delivery."}},{"id":"a0b965fc-948f-420a-a6dc-9b47c8a57140","payload":{"document_id":"9a838db3606cd35581aeea138884d916","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"MANAGEMENT OF STANDARDS AND QUALITY","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Standards-and-Quality.pdf","pageCount":11,"page":7,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Standards-and-Quality.pdf","chunk_index":10,"chunk_start":1974,"chunk_end":2931,"chunk_length":957,"text":"SQ 3.2.2 Faculties are responsible for: (a) approving academic strategies for departments; (b) formally approving and monitoring the structure and content of programmes and modules (on behalf of the institution), and where relevant referring on programme recommendations for institutional approval; (c) monitoring, evaluating and enhancing quality and standards across the faculty; (d) ensuring that appropriate and sufficient resources are available for the delivery of agreed provision.

Record keeping 7.1 Departments have discretion not to make an audio record of a particular viva voce, provided they appoint an independent chair (see clause 6.1)."}},{"id":"b20993e3-b5a8-481a-b94f-f85e77b3bd49","payload":{"document_id":"6815400592695af29b8b6f3565f103fd","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"COLLABORATIVE TEACHING PROVISION","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CTP.pdf","pageCount":26,"page":11,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CTP.pdf","chunk_index":19,"chunk_start":1711,"chunk_end":2209,"chunk_length":498,"text":"CP 4.1.2 The level of scrutiny and investigation will vary according to the type of partnership arrangement, and also the nature and location of the partner, but the approval process for any type of collaborative teaching provision, whether access, articulation, study abroad/exchange or remote delivery, should involve an assessment of the following: (a) whether the proposed partnership aligns with the University’s strategic interests and with faculty and departmental strategies; Version 1.0 10"}},{"id":"b218e176-b789-42d7-a442-de95a9077a65","payload":{"document_id":"72ea550eba281d3ec855e855515ebfe8","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","pageCount":20,"page":1,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","chunk_index":0,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":211,"chunk_length":211,"text":"MANUAL OF ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES 2024-25 POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS (APPLICABLE FROM OCTOBER 2024) Academic Quality, Standards and Conduct Student and Education Services MARP 2024-25"}},{"id":"b24d767a-4107-4786-92f3-2dd6df521a88","payload":{"document_id":"2d73820b57042c9a2ca957b14e2ae49c","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"UNDERGRADUATE ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS INCLUDING REGULATIONS FOR INTEGRATED MASTERS AWARDS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/UG-Assess-Regs.pdf","pageCount":36,"page":7,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/UG-Assess-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":12,"chunk_start":3548,"chunk_end":3561,"chunk_length":13,"text":"Version 1.1 6"}},{"id":"b270b51b-1f8e-4e3c-986c-880181a3a7d6","payload":{"document_id":"72ea550eba281d3ec855e855515ebfe8","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","pageCount":20,"page":19,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","chunk_index":31,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1265,"chunk_length":1265,"text":"MARP 2024-25 Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations (iii) Merit with Distinction in Design 2.6 Exit awards 2.6.1 The Postgraduate Certificate and Postgraduate Diploma are not available as exit awards for this programme.

AA 1.2 However, it is recognised by the University that there are non-academic elements to assessment judgments which might have adversely affected the outcome and that there are occasions where students may wish to appeal against an assessment outcome on such grounds. The procedures set out in this chapter explain how this appeal process will be managed, the responsibilities of all parties, and the opportunity for external scrutiny should students remain dissatisfied with the University’s decisions. AA 1.3 These procedures apply to all current students registered on a Lancaster University programme, with the exception of those students registered on collaborative programmes where an alternative appeals procedure has been formally approved as being procedurally equivalent. Students who want to appeal and are eligible to do so in accordance with AA 1.5 and AA 1.6 must appeal within 15 calendar days of the formal publication of results (except for MBChB students who must declare their intention to appeal within 10 calendar days).

All assessments and marking schemes should be created with the aim of ensuring that the resulting grades/marks give a good indication of the ability and application of the students. However, it is inevitable that on occasion this will not work as planned. 2. Reasons may include a misprinted examination paper, the interruption of an examination or, in a science laboratory, an instrumental malfunction not obvious at the time of the experiment; or it may simply be that examiners agree, using their academic judgment and with the benefit of hindsight, that an assessment, or part of an assessment, proved to be significantly harder or easier than expected. 3. In such cases it is appropriate to consider whether the marks should be scaled. Scaling may be of the overall mark for the module or of any assessment therein. 4. Although an unusual distribution of grades/marks is not of itself a sufficient reason for scaling to be applied, it may be an indication that something has gone wrong. For this reason, if the overall mean aggregation score for any module lies outside the range 14.5- 17.5 (or 58% to 68% for percentage marks) then examiners must consider whether or not there is a case for the marks to be scaled. Note: For International and Regional Teaching Partnership provision the range outside which scaling must be considered is 13.5-17.0 (or 55% to 66.7%) 5. Where the possibility of scaling is being discussed, the precise method should also be discussed and should reflect both the nature of the assessment and the size of the cohort. Both the reason for scaling and the method used must be justified within the minutes of the examining body. If scaling is discussed and not used, the reason for not scaling must be recorded in the minutes."}},{"id":"b67b0b22-ceaf-4a4e-81fd-2e13d1138d0b","payload":{"document_id":"2d73820b57042c9a2ca957b14e2ae49c","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"UNDERGRADUATE ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS INCLUDING REGULATIONS FOR INTEGRATED MASTERS AWARDS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/UG-Assess-Regs.pdf","pageCount":36,"page":8,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/UG-Assess-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":14,"chunk_start":1333,"chunk_end":2607,"chunk_length":1274,"text":"UG 4.2.6 Students opting for a repeat or restart year will: (a) have full-time student status; (b) lose all credit, marks and grades gained in the original Part I year; (c) have a compulsory meeting with their department, arranged by the department to discuss any support needs the student may have, and to be signposted to any other relevant services; (d) be placed on academic probation, with especially close monitoring of academic progress by the major department; (e) otherwise be treated the same as any other Part I student; (f) have one resit opportunity if necessary; (g) not be allowed any further resit opportunity as an external candidate or another repeat year, except under exceptional circumstances where approved by the Part I Resit Board.

Definition of the viva voce 1.1 A viva voce is an oral examination of a research degree thesis, and of the student who wrote it, which is normally conducted in person, at Lancaster, by an internal and an external examiner. 1.2 The first stage of the examination is the review of the student’s thesis. Student and Programme Administration is responsible for sending a copy of the thesis to each examiner. The examiners independently read the thesis and write a Pre-Viva Voce report on it, with comments about its contribution to the field, its strengths and weaknesses, and possibly a range of points which they will raise at the viva voce. 2. Status of the viva voce 2.1 The viva voce is a compulsory part of all research degree examinations unless otherwise specified in the regulations however excellent or poor the thesis may be. The student always has the right to defend their work to the examiners. 2.2 It is not possible under current regulations for a student to fail a research degree outright without undertaking a viva voce. 3. Role of each participant in the viva voce 3.1 The external examiner(s): the role of the external examiner(s) (someone not connected with the University) is to assess the quality of the submission and help to uphold the quality of the degree in the UK. 3.2 In certain circumstances, there may be a third examiner, external to the University, involved to ensure impartiality."}},{"id":"b6c7fd97-c4e7-4570-b707-0c58ff3862b1","payload":{"document_id":"f27acd3b35b06050754e989c2a3570e5","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"Academic Malpractice Regulations and Procedures","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Academic-Integrity-Regs.pdf","pageCount":20,"page":15,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Academic-Integrity-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":27,"chunk_start":1929,"chunk_end":2905,"chunk_length":976,"text":"AM 6.4.3 The Committee shall, having considered all the evidence, have the authority to impose one of the following penalties: (a) that the accusation of academic malpractice is unfounded, the student’s Confirmation of PhD is void, and the student shall be considered as for the first time by a new panel, at a date to be determined; (b) that the accusation is upheld, such that the student is deemed to have failed the requirements for Confirmation of PhD with one opportunity for revision and a second submission to the same panel, at a date to be determined; (c) that the accusation is upheld, such that the student is deemed to have failed the requirements for Confirmation of PhD and the student shall be permanently excluded from the University.

External examiners help to ensure that the standard of awards (with reference to the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications, applicable subject benchmark statements, and relevant professional, statutory and regulatory body requirements) is maintained at the appropriate level; and that the standards of student performance are properly judged against these reference points and are comparable with standards in other UK Higher Education Institutions of which the external examiners have experience.

The outcome of departmental meetings will be formally recorded and communicated to the relevant faculty committees when the proposal documentation goes forward for approval.

For procedural purposes, revisions to programmes and modules are categorised as ‘minor’ or ‘major’. Revisions may be made for a variety of reasons, including: (a) in response to student or external examiner feedback; (b) in response to developments in the subject area; (c) in response to a non-negotiable requirement of a PSRB; (d) in response to practical issues, such as staff changes or changes to student numbers. CD 2.3.2 A major revision involves material changes that affect a programme. A major revision may be either a direct change to a programme and/or significant changes to a module or modules which significantly alter a programme and its delivery, for example, substantive revisions to educational aims, intended learning outcomes, teaching, learning and assessment strategies, academic level, changes to programme structure. The University’s Guidance on revisions to programmes and modules contains examples of major revisions. CD 2.3.3 A minor revision to a programme or module involves a change to the subject matter, method of delivery, or learning, teaching and assessment strategy that: (i) does not affect the programme learning outcomes; (ii) has no significant resources implications; and (iii) is limited to change involving no more than 25% of the programme credits. Some apparently minor revisions may raise broader questions which require further information, fuller discussion or consideration as a major revision. A series of incremental minor revisions should also be considered as a major revision so that consideration is given as to whether or not the volume and nature of these changes significantly alters the programme and its delivery."}},{"id":"bd720697-205e-41e4-a7d6-4f1c7cc65da9","payload":{"document_id":"e702f07444d4250c7c5d5c975b5916d3","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"EXTERNAL EXAMINER PROCEDURES (TAUGHT PROGRAMMES)","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Taught-Progs-EE-Procedures.pdf","pageCount":17,"page":9,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/Taught-Progs-EE-Procedures.pdf","chunk_index":15,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1327,"chunk_length":1327,"text":"MARP 2025-26 External Examiner Procedures (Taught Programmes) EE 2.7 STUDENT INFORMATION ON EXTERNAL EXAMINER APPOINTMENTS EE 2.7.1 Students shall be made aware of the identity and current position of the external examiners appointed to their modules/programmes and awards.

MARP is updated and re-published on an annual basis on 1 September. Publication is via the University web site. For the sake of the integrity of the regulations, there is one published version of MARP only (called the “Current Version”). All previous versions (called “Annual Versions”) are unpublished. The “Current Version” applies to the academic year which typically starts on the 1st of October each year. 2. Each Annual Version is named and archived according to the academic year for which it was published; on 31 August each year the Current Version reverts to its annual publication reference (e.g. “MARP 2019-20”). The Annual Versions are archived and held by Academic Quality, Standards and Conduct on behalf of the University. APPLICATION OF ACADEMIC REGULATIONS: APPLICANTS AND STUDENTS 3. The Current Version of MARP forms part of the contractual relationship between the University and: a) all students currently registered with the University, irrespective of year of course, year of entry and their registration status; b) all applicants who have accepted a formal offer of a place by the University (and are therefore potential students). 4. The University formally enters into a contract with an applicant from the point at which an applicant accepts an offer of a place at the University."}},{"id":"c1aaacbd-8fd7-4e34-a519-04dd4761edf6","payload":{"document_id":"6815400592695af29b8b6f3565f103fd","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"COLLABORATIVE TEACHING PROVISION","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CTP.pdf","pageCount":26,"page":7,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CTP.pdf","chunk_index":11,"chunk_start":1983,"chunk_end":3177,"chunk_length":1194,"text":"MoAs clarify the terms of the agreement, the rights, responsibilities and obligations, constraints, financial arrangements, and set out the terms on which the agreement can be terminated.

All assessments and marking schemes should be created with the aim of ensuring that the resulting grades/marks give a good indication of the ability and application of the students. However, it is inevitable that on occasion this will not work as planned. 2. Reasons may include a misprinted examination paper, the interruption of an examination or, in a science laboratory, an instrumental malfunction not obvious at the time of the experiment; or it may simply be that examiners agree, using their academic judgment and with the benefit of hindsight, that an assessment, or part of an assessment, proved to be significantly harder or easier than expected. 3. In such cases it is appropriate to consider whether the marks should be scaled. Scaling may be of the overall mark for the module or of any assessment therein. 4. Although an unusual distribution of grades/marks is not of itself a sufficient reason for scaling to be applied, it may be an indication that something has gone wrong. For this reason, if the overall mean aggregation score for any module lies outside the range 14.5-17.5 (or 58% to 68% for percentage marks) then examiners must consider whether or not there is a case for the marks to be scaled. Note: For International and Regional Teaching Partnership provision the range outside which scaling must be considered is 13.5-17.0 (or 55% to 66.7%) 5. Where the possibility of scaling is being discussed, the precise method should also be discussed and should reflect both the nature of the assessment and the size of the cohort. Both the reason for scaling and the method used must be justified within the minutes of the examining body.

Amended regulations that are applicable to different cohorts of students are differentiated within MARP at the appropriate place.2 AMENDMENTS TO THE ACADEMIC REGULATIONS – RELATED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES 7. Amendments may be made to MARP which impact on applicants between the offer and registration stage, and which represent a change to the University’s terms and conditions and therefore the contract with the applicant. In accordance with the CMA guidance on consumer law in relation to Higher Education,3 the University will inform applicants of any significant changes to the academic regulations since they first applied. 8. Irrespective of when a new/amended academic regulation is introduced, current students are consulted on any significant amendments through the student representation on the relevant University committees. 9. The application of new/amended regulations to particular cohorts of students will be agreed as part of the approval process for the change. 10. Notwithstanding paragraph 7 above, wherever possible, applicants should be provided with the version of the academic regulations which will be in place when they enter the programme. New/amended academic regulations should then have been approved by 1 September in the year prior to them taking effect (e.g. by 1 September 2020 for introduction from October 2021)."}},{"id":"d760d811-2d03-44a6-be31-a13b8c808f2a","payload":{"document_id":"72ea550eba281d3ec855e855515ebfe8","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","pageCount":20,"page":4,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGT-Assess-Regs-previous-year.pdf","chunk_index":4,"chunk_start":0,"chunk_end":1849,"chunk_length":1849,"text":"MARP 2024-25 Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations PT 3.2 To qualify for an award, candidates should pass all the assessments required by their programme and be awarded credits, or have assessments condoned, as follows: (a) for a taught Masters degree, a total of at least 180 credits, with no more than 30 credits having been defined as being undergraduate in level; (b) for a Postgraduate Diploma, a total of at least 120 credits, with no more than 30 credits having been defined as being undergraduate in level; (c) for a Postgraduate Certificate, a total of at least 60 credits, with no more than 20 credits having been defined as being undergraduate in level.

Changes to the University’s academic regulations are approved by the Academic Standards and Quality Committee (ASQC) on behalf of Education Committee. Programme-specific regulations are approved as part of the programme approval process for new and amended programmes. VERSIONS OF MARP: NAMING, PUBLICATION AND ARCHIVING 1. MARP is updated and re-published on an annual basis on 1 September. Publication is via the University web site. For the sake of the integrity of the regulations, there is one published version of MARP only (called the “Current Version”). All previous versions (called “Annual Versions”) are unpublished. The “Current Version” applies to the academic year which typically starts on the 1st of October each year. 2. Each Annual Version is named and archived according to the academic year for which it was published; on 31 August each year the Current Version reverts to its annual publication reference (e.g. “MARP 2019-20”). The Annual Versions are archived and held by Academic Quality, Standards and Conduct on behalf of the University. APPLICATION OF ACADEMIC REGULATIONS: APPLICANTS AND STUDENTS 3. The Current Version of MARP forms part of the contractual relationship between the University and: a) all students currently registered with the University, irrespective of year of course, year of entry and their registration status; b) all applicants who have accepted a formal offer of a place by the University (and are therefore potential students). 4. The University formally enters into a contract with an applicant from the point at which an applicant accepts an offer of a place at the University."}},{"id":"d7d5a066-4d56-4fbd-b747-3b5538456873","payload":{"document_id":"a593380d7ea48719b30d71783d2613aa","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"77b6f9e5-1ebb-48fb-9176-90319075c977","title":"POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH REGULATIONS","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGR-Regs.pdf","pageCount":55,"page":43,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/PGR-Regs.pdf","chunk_index":81,"chunk_start":1865,"chunk_end":2632,"chunk_length":767,"text":"The publications must also provide evidence of the capacity of the candidate to pursue further research, representing a coherent contribution to research in a given field and demonstrating a depth of scholarship and originality comparable with that required in a PhD thesis.

CD 1.1.3 However, staff in academic departments are encouraged to discuss any issues of principle or concern, or any particularly innovative or complex proposals, with Faculty Associate Deans, Faculty Quality Assurance and Enhancement Managers and/or members of the Academic Quality, Standards and Conduct (AQSC) team as early as possible in the design and development process. CD 1.1.4 If necessary, for example where a proposed degree programme is outwith the award/ programme criteria approved by Senate (see The Portfolio of Degree Awards, PA 3), approval in principle for a programme can be sought from the appropriate committee(s) early in the process, before the proposal is fully worked up for consideration by departmental or the faculty committees responsible for oversight. This will avoid staff spending time developing proposals that might not be granted approval. AQSC will consult the University Academic Dean and/or the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education) as appropriate. Proposals may be modified or developed further following such discussions. Advice about seeking approval in principle is available from AQSC."}},{"id":"d9e6fce6-edba-4f7f-90f0-6fafba1021e7","payload":{"document_id":"6815400592695af29b8b6f3565f103fd","file_type":"pdf","correlation_id":"f6ebd5e1-e1b2-4390-94d8-675d40d3d0b8","title":"COLLABORATIVE TEACHING PROVISION","sourceUrl":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CTP.pdf","pageCount":26,"page":8,"url":"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/student-based-services/asq/marp/CTP.pdf","chunk_index":13,"chunk_start":1738,"chunk_end":3128,"chunk_length":1390,"text":"CP 3 GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT CP 3.1 COMMITTEES CP 3.1.1 Senate is the University body with ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the standards and quality of the University’s collaborative provision are equivalent to those of the University’s own internal programmes.

Any such variation must be approved by the faculty Associate Dean. In order to be awarded the credits from study abroad the assessment devised by the department and approved by an Associate Dean must be broadly comparable and proportionate and should demonstrate learning outcomes relevant to the study abroad experience.

All assessments and marking schemes should be created with the aim of ensuring that the resulting grades/marks give a good indication of the ability and application of the students. However, it is inevitable that on occasion this will not work as planned. 2. Reasons may include a misprinted examination paper, the interruption of an examination or, in a science laboratory, an instrumental malfunction not obvious at the time of the experiment; or it may simply be that examiners agree, using their academic judgment and with the benefit of hindsight, that an assessment, or part of an assessment, proved to be significantly harder or easier than expected. 3. In such cases it is appropriate to consider whether the marks should be scaled. Scaling may be of the overall mark for the module or of any assessment therein. 4. Although an unusual distribution of grades/marks is not of itself a sufficient reason for scaling to be applied, it may be an indication that something has gone wrong. For this reason, if the overall mean aggregation score for any module lies outside the range 14.5-17.5 (or 58% to 68% for percentage marks) then examiners must consider whether or not there is a case for the marks to be scaled. Note: For International and Regional Teaching Partnership provision the range outside which scaling must be considered is 13.5-17.0 (or 55% to 66.7%) 5. Where the possibility of scaling is being discussed, the precise method should also be discussed and should reflect both the nature of the assessment and the size of the cohort. Both the reason for scaling and the method used must be justified within the minutes of the examining body.

All assessments and marking schemes should be created with the aim of ensuring that the resulting grades/marks give a good indication of the ability and application of the students. However, it is inevitable that on occasion this will not work as planned. 2. Reasons may include a misprinted examination paper, the interruption of an examination or, in a science laboratory, an instrumental malfunction not obvious at the time of the experiment; or it may simply be that examiners agree, using their academic judgment and with the benefit of hindsight, that an assessment, or part of an assessment, proved to be significantly harder or easier than expected. 3. In such cases it is appropriate to consider whether the marks should be scaled. Scaling may be of the overall mark for the module or of any assessment therein. 4. Although an unusual distribution of grades/marks is not of itself a sufficient reason for scaling to be applied, it may be an indication that something has gone wrong. For this reason, if the overall mean aggregation score for any module lies outside the range 14.5- 17.5 (or 58% to 68% for percentage marks) then examiners must consider whether or not there is a case for the marks to be scaled. Note: For International and Regional Teaching Partnership provision the range outside which scaling must be considered is 13.5-17.0 (or 55% to 66.7%) 5.

UG 7.6.2 Where, for whatever reason, reassessment at Part II is not available before the end of the academic year, the examination board may condone credit even where the aggregation score is below the condonable threshold. For students not in their final year, where a student has failed more than 30 but not more than 45 credits, 15 credits may be set aside – normally this will be for the module with the lowest fail mark. The student may progress to the next year of study, and will undertake an additional 15 credits (uncapped) in that year. UG 7.6.3 Where a mark of zero has been applied to the whole module as a penalty for academic malpractice with no opportunity for reassessment, the exam board shall ordinarily exceptionally condone this mark provided that this does not lead to the student having more than the permitted number of condoned credits as specified in these regulations.

The characteristics of the European Doctorate are those of the traditional Lancaster PhD with the following amendments. (a) The thesis should be reviewed by at least two academics from different higher education institutions in different EU countries, excluding the UK. At least one member of the exam board should come from an EU country other than the UK. In the Lancaster context, this requirement would most easily be implemented by having two External Examiners at the board from EU countries other than the UK.

(c) The thesis must have been prepared partly as a result of a research period of at least one term spent at an institution in an EU country other than the UK. 39.

Level: the Lancaster MD shall be a research degree that contains research conducted at the doctoral level, both in terms of the publishable quality of research that is expected in the thesis, and when viewed alongside the QAA's FHEQ level descriptors. It shall be comparable in level to the Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy). 27. Content: the degree will be awarded for research by thesis or by publication. The thesis should contain original work of publishable quality, but not necessarily in a publishable format. An award based on published work (defined as papers produced during registration) will use the same criteria as the University's existing multi-part thesis format. 28. Duration: candidates will demonstrate, as an element of admissions, suitable prior experience in their chosen area of clinical study so as to be able to provide a basis for research equivalent to one-year of doctoral research; thereafter there will be a two-year minimum period of registration, full-time (or equivalent); exceptionally less for MD by published work. 29.

External examiners help to ensure that the standard of awards (with reference to the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications, applicable subject benchmark statements, and relevant professional, statutory and regulatory body requirements) is maintained at the appropriate level; and that the standards of student performance are properly judged against these reference points and are comparable with standards in other UK Higher Education Institutions of which the external examiners have experience. EE 1.2.2 External examiners also provide comment and recommendations on good practice and innovation in relation to learning, teaching and assessment in order to highlight potential to enhance the quality of the learning opportunities provided to students.

The European Doctorate is a qualification that was created by the Confederation of EU Rectors’ Conference (now the European University Association) and provides the opportunity to study for a qualification which meets the criteria which are commonly understood to be met in a doctorate, using examination procedures that are widely recognised across Europe, involving an ability to work in more than one language, and entailing periods of time spent working in institution across more than one EU member state. 38. The characteristics of the European Doctorate are those of the traditional Lancaster PhD with the following amendments. (a) The thesis should be reviewed by at least two academics from different higher education institutions in different EU countries, excluding the UK. At least one member of the exam board should come from an EU country other than the UK. In the Lancaster context, this requirement would most easily be implemented by having two External Examiners at the board from EU countries other than the UK. (b) Part of the defence must take place in one of the official languages of the EU other than English. (c) The thesis must have been prepared partly as a result of a research period of at least one term spent at an institution in an EU country other than the UK. 39. The European doctorate is available in any of the areas in which the PhD is currently available at Lancaster, and is offered under the title of European Doctorate in XXXX, with postnominal letters of PhD. DSc and DLitt 40. To be eligible for the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) or of Doctor of Letters (DLitt), candidates shall be either graduates of the University, or members of staff of the University, whose record of published work and research shows conspicuous ability and originality and constitutes a distinguished and sustained achievement. 41."}}],"next_page_offset":null},"status":"ok","time":0.047095591}
